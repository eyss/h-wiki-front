# H-Wiki

Frontend code for H-Wiki, see [H-Wiki](https://github.com/eyss/h-wiki-back) for DNA code.

H-Wiki is a hApp (holochain application) that allows groups and communities to create their own wiki-like repositories of information.

Each wiki is created with an initial administrator, that can grant `administrator` or `editor` roles to any other user that joins the hApp.

npm install
npm start
```

You will be automatically redirected to `https://localhost:3000`.
